  ## Installation
  To use this application, you will need to clone the repository found [here](https://github.com/alyssawinn/orm-backend), download Node to your local machine, install Dotenv, Sequelize, Express, and MySql using the command 'npm install sequelize mysql2 dotenv express' in your terminal. This will add the necessary node_modules folder and ability to do SQL in the terminal and utilize Sequelize. Run 'schema.sql' and then do 'npm run seed' from the terminal to add the current database to the program. Once that's complete, you can type 'npm start' in the terminal to start the application and use the associated URL's to create, read, update, and destroy data in Insomnia.
